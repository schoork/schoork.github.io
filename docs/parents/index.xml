      <description>Appointments Parent Appointments is a module that allows parents to request an appointment with a staff member. When the parent requests the appointment, the staff member (and their supervisors) are notificed via email. Staff members will see a badge count in their sidebar of the number of incomplete appointments they have.
Workflow The diagram below shows the general workflow of a parent appointment in Schoork. In this diagram the orange boxes represent actions that a person needs to take, while the blue boxes are tasks that Schoork automates.</description>

      <description>Concerns When a parent has a concern or request, they can submit a Parent Concern via Schoork. When the parent submits the concern, they must pick a staff member to submit the concern to. The staff member (and their supervisors) are notificed via email. Staff members will see a badge count in their sidebar of the number of incomplete concerns they have.
