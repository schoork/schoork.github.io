<div class="book-tabs"><input type="radio" class="hidden" name="tabs-meetings" id="tabs-meetings-0" checked="checked" />
  <label for="tabs-meetings-0">Inviting Parents and Users</label>
  <div class="book-tabs-content markdown-inner"><p>When you add or edit a meeting, you can invite users and parents. To
invite parents, they must have a <a href="/docs/parents/">parent account</a>, although they do not
need to be linked to the student.</p>
<p>When you add users, you also assign them a role, which is used on
several forms (including the <em>MET Documentation</em> form and the <em>Attendance</em>
form). Only users with the <strong>Agency Representative</strong> role will be able
to assign the <em>Amendment</em> form.</p>
<h3 id="sending-invites">Sending Invites</h3>
<p>Saving the IEP Meeting does not immediately make the meeting available
to parents and users. The members invited to the meeting will be listed
under the <strong>Invitees</strong> section. Clicking the <strong>Send Invites</strong> button
will send an automated email to the parents and users, allowing them to
access the meeting and its forms and documents and giving them the
ability to RSVP to the meeting.</p>
</div><input type="radio" class="hidden" name="tabs-meetings" id="tabs-meetings-1"  />
  <label for="tabs-meetings-1">Forms</label>
  <div class="book-tabs-content markdown-inner"><p>Every IEP meeting comes with all of the forms you would need for any
meeting. Those that are used in all meetings, such as the <em>Attendance</em>
form, are automatically added. Forms that you may only use sometimes,
like the <em>MET Documentation</em> form, must be added by clicking the <strong>Add</strong>
button.</p>
<h3 id="status">Status</h3>
<p>Most forms have a status that is defaulted to <em>Draft</em>. When a form is in
<em>Draft</em> mode, parents and users will not be able to sign them or print
them. When you have completed editing a form, and are ready for others
to see/sign it, change the status to <em>Draft Completed</em>.</p>
<h3 id="signing-forms">Signing Forms</h3>
<p>If users and parents have set their <a href="/docs/misc/signatures">signatures</a>,
they can digitally sign forms (otherwise they will have to sign the
forms the old fashioned way). Each digital signature will show the
person&rsquo;s signature, their name, their role for the meeting (see
<em>Inviting Parents and Users</em>), and the timestamp of when they signed the
form.</p>
</div><input type="radio" class="hidden" name="tabs-meetings" id="tabs-meetings-2"  />
  <label for="tabs-meetings-2">Documents</label>
  <div class="book-tabs-content markdown-inner">You can also upload documents by editing the meeting and using the <strong>Add
File</strong> button. This feature is avaialble for adding hand-signed forms
and other documents relevant to the meeting.</div></div>

<h2 id="academic-and-behavior-goals">Academic and Behavior Goals</h2>
<p>IEPs also have a way to set and log academic and behavioral goals for
students. Once set, data for these goals can be logged manually so that
Schoork can automatically create charts showing the student&rsquo;s progress
over time.</p>
<p>The <strong>Report of Progress</strong> button will download a report showing the
student&rsquo;s progress as compared to their target.</p>
<p>Behavioral goals can be added this way or can be added using the
<a href="/docs/students/behavior_trackers">Student Supports and Behavior
Trackers</a> module. If data is added
using behavior trackers, it will be automatically added to charts on the
IEP, too.</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p><strong>IEP Meetings</strong> are a prime example of how we at Schoork believe
software should act. When you were using paper forms, or even forms from
some other <em>digital</em> IEP providers, you had to type or write the same
information on multiple forms. That&rsquo;s time you could spend doing other,
more important things (i.e. working with students, planning lessons,
spending time with your family, sipping mai tais on the beach, etc.).</p>
<p>Instead, our IEP forms use the information entered once to populate
as many forms as possible.</p>
