      <description>Hall Passes Hall passes are a mostly mobile feature. While hall passes might be easy to use with pre-printed tickets or scraps of paper and sticky notes, digital hall passes do afford the feature of automated data collection. With digital hall passes, you can which students are in the halls the most, how long students are out of class, and which teachers are allowing students to leave their classroom the most.</description>

      <description>Tardy Slips Tardy slips are a mostly mobile feature. They are designed to be printed on a mobile printer when they are assigned.
Mobile Printers Currently Schoork supports printing on the Zebra iMZ220 (discontinued) and the ZQ310. If your school doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a mobile printer but would like to invest in some, we do recommend the ZQ310. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to use and already works with Schoork. If you have a mobile printer that&amp;rsquo;s not listed on our list of supported printers, please contact us.</description>
