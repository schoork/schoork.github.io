      <description>Signatures Schoork allows for the digital signing of forms for IEPs and financial forms. Users and parents can set their signature one time, and then use Schoork to digitally sign documents. Documents signed with a digital signature print the name of the user (or parent) and the timestamp when they signed the form.
Signing Passwords Note: For the sake of brevity below, a user can mean either a user or a parent.</description>
