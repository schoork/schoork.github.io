      <description>Appointments Parent Appointments is a module that allows parents to request an appointment with a staff member. When the parent requests the appointment, the staff member (and their supervisors) are notified via email. Staff members will see a badge count in their sidebar of the number of incomplete appointments they have.
Workflow The diagram below shows the general workflow of a parent appointment in Schoork. In this diagram the orange boxes represent actions that a person needs to take, while the blue boxes are tasks that Schoork automates.</description>

While hall passes might be easy to use with pre-printed tickets or scraps of paper and sticky notes, digital hall passes do afford the feature of automated data collection. With digital hall passes, you can which students are in the halls the most, how long students are out of class, and which teachers are allowing students to leave their classroom the most.</description>

      <description>Tardy Slips Tardy slips are a mostly mobile feature. They are designed to be printed on a mobile printer when they are assigned.
Mobile Printers Currently Schoork supports printing on the Zebra iMZ220 (discontinued) and the ZQ310. If your school doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a mobile printer but would like to invest in some, we do recommend the ZQ310. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to use and already works with Schoork. If you have a mobile printer that&amp;rsquo;s not listed on our list of supported printers, please contact us.</description>
