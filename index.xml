      <description>Appointments Parent Appointments is a module that allows parents to request an appointment with a staff member. When the parent requests the appointment, the staff member (and their supervisors) are notified via email. Staff members will see a badge count in their sidebar of the number of incomplete appointments they have.
Workflow The diagram below shows the general workflow of a parent appointment in Schoork. In this diagram the orange boxes represent actions that a person needs to take, while the blue boxes are tasks that Schoork automates.</description>

      <description>Forms Note: This page describes forms that parents sign. To learn more about forms that users submit, go to the User Forms page.
Tired of handling multiple paper forms that parents have to sign? We can turn those paper forms into digital ones so that you can have parents sign them digitally. This means less printing, less scanning, and a more seamless process.
Paper forms generally mean that parents have to write out information that schools already have (like phone numbers and email addresses), wasting their time.</description>

Mobile Printers Currently Schoork supports printing on the Zebra iMZ220 (discontinued) and the ZQ310. If your school doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a mobile printer but would like to invest in some, we do recommend the ZQ310. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to use and already works with Schoork. If you have a mobile printer that&amp;rsquo;s not listed on our list of supported printers, please contact us.</description>
