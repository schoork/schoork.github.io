The form allows your district to gather wanted information about a student one time and print it on as many forms as desired. Information, such as a student\u0026rsquo;s name, birthdate, grade, and school are collected once from the parent but printed on every single form. This is meant to decrease the amount of time it takes parents to complete the registration process for their child(ren) and can also be used to accomodate offsite registration.\nVerifcation In working with a school district in Mississippi, we found that it was highly valuable to have a parent complete the registration process with a staff member to ensure all information was correct and completed. We added a small module to flag students for different forms that had been signed (i.e. media release, internet and device usage, etc.).\nAutomated Upload Schoork also supports automated uploads from your original Student Management System using a variety of formats for transfer, including SFTP and API methods. We will work with you to streamline this process so you can set it up once and not think about it again. Removing Students Schoork will not allow you to delete students, however, you can mark them as inactive. This process can be automated if you are using the Automated Upload from your SMS (above) or can be done manually by users with the Scheduling permission.\nTL;DR We don\u0026rsquo;t allow you to remove or delete students because too many modules rely on an associated student (or set of students) to function. For instance, every office referral, IEP, MTSS folder, and counseling session is assigned to one or more students. Deleting a student would mean that you couldn\u0026rsquo;t access those referrals ever again.\nIn the example below, removing Student01 would mean that we would lose Referral01 and Referral02 and would not be able to access them for data or historical purpsoses.\n   mermaid.initialize({ flowchart: { useMaxWidth:true } });  classDiagram Student01 "});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/docs/users/','title':"Users",'content':"Users Users are people who can access the bulk of the data in Schoork. They are generally employees in your organization.\nOther groups with accounts in Schoork are Parents and Guests. Both of these groups are much more limited in the scope of what they can access in Schoork.\nAdding Users There are two ways to add users in Schoork.\n One-by-One - Users with the Admin permission can do this Batch Upload - Authorized users can send a specifically formatted CSV file to sam@schoork.com with the users they want added  Either way, when a user is added to Schoork, they will receive an automated email from noreply@schoork.com. This email welcomes them and gives them a login link and temporary password.\nNo one but a user can set their password. Temporary passwords are generated via a hashing algorithm to protect users\u0026rsquo; accounts and your data.  Permissions Throughout this documentation site you will see phrases like users with the Admin permission. Schoork comes with a lot of permissions that can be assigned to users. Permissions give users the power to add, edit, and see more data throughout the site. They are also used for notifications when certain events occur.\nThe Admin Permission The most powerful permission in Schoork is the Admin permission. We highly suggest that only a few individuals in your organization have this permission. Users with the Admin permission are responsible for almost all of the one-time setup for different modules. For instance, they add behaviors and consequences for office referrals, create observation types and questions for observations, and build out periods and courses for scheduling students into sections.\nTemporary Login Users with the Admin permission can also temporarily login as other users. This can be helpful if you need to help a user troubleshoot a problem they\u0026rsquo;re having and need to see what they are seeing.\nSince signing passwords are required when approving forms and signing documents, unless the user with the Admin permission knows the other user\u0026rsquo;s signing password, they can\u0026rsquo;t sign for them.  Site-based Permissions Site-based permissions are site-wide, meaning that a user can make use of those permissions from anywhere within Schoork, regardless of the school. The Admin permission is a site-based permission.\nThe following are the site-based permissions available in Schoork.\n   Permission Access Abilities Notifications     Accounts Payable Financials Section Assign purchase order numbers to requisitions When requisitions are fully approved   Federal Programs Budgets (in Financials Section) Add and edit budgets    Fixed Assets  Add fixed assets to inventory    Forms Financials Section Can add some forms for other users    Meetings  Add meetings and view feedback    Memos  Can send memos to other users    Observations  Can add observations and evaluations     School-based Permissions When adding users, you can assign them to schools. This tells Schoork how to scope students to the user. For instance, a user who is assigned to the elementary and middle school, but not the high school, will be able to view the names and submit referrals for students from the elementary and middle school.\nYou can also assign users school-based permissions at each school they are assigned to. These permissions are school-based so the user can only get those abilities and notifications when dealing with students at that particular school.\nBelow is an example of what a user can do with the Referrals permission at one school but not the other.\n  mermaid.initialize({ flowchart: { useMaxWidth:true } });  classDiagram User --| Elementary School User --| Middle School class Elementary School { +permission Referrals } Elementary School   Permission Abilities Notifications     Announcements Create and send announcements    Attendance Take attendance for all sections Daily attendance reminders   Child Find Requests Can view all child find requests When requests submitted   Counseling Add counseling sessions, complete screeners    Discipline Complete referrals, complete screeners, add to hot list, view behavior tracker summary When referrals submitted, daily behavior tracker summary   Safety View all safety incidents When safety incident submitted   Scheduling Add sections and add students to sections    Support Add supports for students, assign behavior trackers Daily behavior tracker summary   Tickets (Maintenance) View and complete all maintenance tickets When maintenance tickets submitted   Tickets (Technology) View and complete all technology tickets When technology tickets submitted   Weekly Digest  Recieve weekly school digest on Fridays    School-based Forms You can also ensure users are notified (and must approve) when school-based forms are submitted. This is possible for the following types of forms.\n Deposits Facility Use Requests Fundraisers Fixed Asset Requests  Students You can assign individual students to users if you want them to receive a notification whenever a referral or safety incident is submitted for this student. This is helpful if you have particular mentors or case managers assigned to students.\nIf you want a user to receive a notification when a referral is submitted for any student in a school, use the School-based permission instead.\nSupervisors Supervisors represent a connection between two users in which one is a manager of the other. Supervisors are able to see certain records submitted by the users they supervise. For instance, a supervisor can see all of the parent contacts created by themself and the users they supervise.\nSpecial Options Supervisors are notified whenever a user submits one of the following forms.\n Overtime Request Personal Activity Report Semi-Annual Certification Time Off Request Travel Request  You can also give supervisors the following other abilities.\n Approve all of the form types listed above. View observations, quick coachings, and evaluations of the user. View the user\u0026rsquo;s vault items.  You can edit the users a supervisor manages at one time, by going to the supervisor\u0026rsquo;s page and clicking the Edit button under Supervisees.\nFunds Funds are a way to identify employees who are paid partially or fully through federal funds. This option is not intended to be used for employees that are fully funded through state and/or local funds.\nYou can add the different funds that pay the salary and benefits of a user, and Schoork will determine if that user is fully or partially funded through federal funds. Partially funded users will recieve a notification to submit a Personal Activity Report every thirty days. Fully funded users will receive a notification to submit a Semi-Annual Certification in December and May. These notifications will also be sent to the user\u0026rsquo;s supervisor(s).\nIf you do not see a funds option when adding and editing users, it is because the federal option is turned off for your organization.

It is required for parents to do this before they sign a form, but they will only have to do it once.\n"});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/docs/misc/','title':"Miscellaneous",'content':""});index.add({'id':5,'href':'/post/','title':"Posts",'content':""});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/post/signing-forms-in-the-age-of-covid/','title':"Signing Forms in the Age of COVID",'content':"Paper Forms in a Contactless Age We recently spoke to a school principal who was distributing iPads and laptops to students to help them with distance learning. The form he had to use required the signature of the student, the parent, and a school employee, ensuring close contact with three different people. “In a time when we need to limit contact with others, three of us signing a form, potentially with the same pen, seems careless,” he said.\nIEP meetings are another time when multiple people have to sign the same document. Before the pandemic, this was an easy - passing a piece of paper around a conference table. Now, most people are likely in different places, making this a complicated mess of printing, signing, and scanning, and it is only possible if all people involved have access to a printer and scanner.\nPossible Solutions Most big document signers give you two types of options for digital signing, but both of these require more work than you think.\nA Single, Uploaded Form One option is to upload a single form, for instance, a device checkout form. When it comes time for the parent to sign, they authenticate, fill out the fields of the form, and sign it digitally.\nWhile this means your employees don’t have to put in a lot of work, your parents will. For the parents of three or four students in your school, these form fields can mean a lot of added time.\nLots of Uploading If you want to take the burden off your parents, you can opt for the Big Box’s other solution, uploading many forms. You might use a digital IEP software to create a notice of invitation for an individual child’s meeting, upload it, and then send the parent a link to sign it.\nThis method eliminates all the unnecessary fields that your parents have to fill out, but it does mean your employees are uploading a lot of files. What if everyone in the district checks out a device, or you want to incorporate your media release form into this process? Now your people are spending too much time uploading forms.\nSchoork - The Best of Both Neither of those solutions seems just right; they both have significant drawbacks. Schoork allows you to take the best of both solutions, reducing the work on your employees and your parents.\n  mermaid.initialize({ flowchart: { useMaxWidth:true } });  graph TD a[Data synced with student management system]:::auto b[Employee enters information for form]:::work c[Form sent to parent]:::auto d[Parent signs form]:::work e[Employee notified]:::auto f[Parent and employee can print form]:::work a -- b b -- c c -- d d -- e \u0026 f classDef auto fill:#6bf classDef work fill:#f96 In the above chart, blue boxes represent automated actions\nAutomating Form Creation Each form, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a device checkout form or an IEP meeting attendance form, will have some specific parameters. The employee enters these through the same familiar Schoork interface they use.\nIn the case of an IEP form, which might have a student\u0026rsquo;s name, grade, school, or parent\u0026rsquo;s information, this data doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be entered every time since it is tied to the student. The employee gets all of this extra data added to the form for free by selecting the student\u0026rsquo;s name. Now all that\u0026rsquo;s left is for the parent to sign the form.\nKeeping it Secure Besides having to sign into Schoork to sign a form, parents and employees have to enter a signing password whenever they sign a document or form. Schoork stores the signing password in an encrypted format, meaning the password is secure from forgery. This password ensures that parents intend to sign the document (a requirement of the E-Sign Act of 2000).\nRecord Retention Another requirement of the E-Sign Act is to allow for parties to access and print the form whenever they want. Parents can print the forms they sign by signing into their Schoork account. All it takes is the press of a button to give you something like this below.\n"});index.add({'id':7,'href':'/docs/','title':"Docs",'content':"About Me I started working in education after college as a alternative route teacher. Since I have worked as a teacher, administrator-in-training, assistant principal, principal, and associate superintendent in several districts and one charter organization in Mississippi and Tennessee.\nIn my roles I became increasingly frustrated with the state of educational technology, which tends to be built poorly (here\u0026rsquo;s looking at you TIMS) and/or ineffectively. A lot of times software is built by engineers who don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of experience in the field, and when educators and engineers can\u0026rsquo;t speak the same language, we get programs that make us work harder than pencil and paper would.\nAs I became more frustrated, I sought to do something about that. First I started with Google Apps Scripts, a backend, JavaScript-like service that allows you to automate Google\u0026rsquo;s frontend services (i.e. Forms, Spreadsheets, Docs, etc.). I eventually moved from PHP to Python, and, finally, to Ruby on Rails. With the help of some books, the internet, and some really awesome friends, I built Schoork.\nAbout Schoork Schoork is designed and built to make educators\u0026rsquo; jobs easier and more efficient. It is a set of digital tools that schools and districts can use to increase productivity and transparency within their organizations.\nSchoork achieves this through three main methods:\n Automated communication between platforms and people Digitizing the non-digital Built-in flexibility  Navigating the Site Left Sidebar The left sidebar is where you will find access to all pages on this support site. They are generally broken into the same major sections as the sidebar on Schoork.  Search If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for something in particular, try the search box in the left sidebar. It searches every page on this site for what you\u0026rsquo;re you type.  Right Sidebar The right sidebar lists all of the major sections on the given page you\u0026rsquo;re on. Click one to be instantly taken to that part of the page.   Ten Minute Rule We ask that your try to use our site to answer the question(s) you have, but if you are spending more than ten minutes and still can\u0026rsquo;t figure it out, email us and we will respond as quickly as we can.  Navigating Schoork Sidebar Schoork also has a sidebar. Schoork\u0026rsquo;s sidebar is divided into major sections (students, users, financials, and setup) and subsections. Clicking on a module takes it to it\u0026rsquo;s main page, while clicking the (Add) link next to it will take you to a new form.  Buttons Buttons are the other ways to get around in Schoork. Most module pages have a table listing a bunch of records. Generally these tables will have buttons like show, edit, print, remove. These tend to be very consistent across the site of what they do.

Sections require periods and courses.\nSections Users with the Scheduling permission can add sections and assign students to them.\nMeeting days allows Schoork to send an automated attendance reminder in the afternoon to all teachers who haven\u0026rsquo;t taken attendance for a section that meets on that day. If a class meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays, then the teacher won\u0026rsquo;t receive the reminder on Mondays, Wednesdays, or Fridays.\nTo add students to a section, select the desired student or students (hold CTRL or ⌘ to select multiple students) and click the green arrow button. The red arrow button is used to remove students from the section.\nAttendance Codes Users with the Admin permission can add attendance codes from the Setup section in the sidebar. Each attendance code is asssigned a name and short name.\nAttendance codes are either absent codes (checked) or present codes (unchecked). Students assigned an absent code are listed on the Daily Absences page.\nYou can set the order that attendance codes appear when a user takes attendance by ordering them in the table on the main Attendance Codes page. Simply drag and drop them until they are ordered the way you want. We recommend that you have the most used code be the one listed first, since all students will default to this code when users take attendance.\nPeriods and Courses Periods and courses can be added by users with the Admin permission in the Setup section of the sidebar. Daily Absences The Daily Absences page lists the students who have been marked as absent for any section. Users with the Attendance permission can change the attendance code of a student by clicking on the blue code.\nThe page also lists the sections for which users have not yet taken attendance that also meet that day (see Initial Setup above).

Clicking the Send Invites button will send an automated email to the parents and users, allowing them to access the meeting and its forms and documents and giving them the ability to RSVP to the meeting.\nForms Every IEP meeting comes with all of the forms you would need for any meeting. Those that are used in all meetings, such as the Attendance form, are automatically added. Forms that you may only use sometimes, like the MET Documentation form, must be added by clicking the Add button.\nStatus Most forms have a status that is defaulted to Draft. When a form is in Draft mode, parents and users will not be able to sign them or print them. When you have completed editing a form, and are ready for others to see/sign it, change the status to Draft Completed.\nSigning Forms If users and parents have set their signatures, they can digitally sign forms (otherwise they will have to sign the forms the old fashioned way). Each digital signature will show the person\u0026rsquo;s signature, their name, their role for the meeting (see Inviting Parents and Users), and the timestamp of when they signed the form.\nDocuments You can also upload documents by editing the meeting and using the Add File button. This feature is avaialble for adding hand-signed forms and other documents relevant to the meeting. Academic and Behavior Goals IEPs also have a way to set and log academic and behavioral goals for students. Once set, data for these goals can be logged manually so that Schoork can automatically create charts showing the student\u0026rsquo;s progress over time.\nThe Report of Progress button will download a report showing the student\u0026rsquo;s progress as compared to their target.\nBehavioral goals can be added this way or can be added using the Student Supports and Behavior Trackers module. If data is added using behavior trackers, it will be automatically added to charts on the IEP, too.\nTL;DR IEP Meetings are a prime example of how we at Schoork believe software should act. When you were using paper forms, or even forms from some other digital IEP providers, you had to type or write the same information on multiple forms. That\u0026rsquo;s time you could spend doing other, more important things (i.e. working with students, planning lessons, spending time with your family, sipping mai tais on the beach, etc.).\nInstead, our IEP forms use the information entered once to populate as many forms as possible.\n "});index.add({'id':16,'href':'/docs/misc/mobile_printers/','title':"Mobile Printers",'content':"Mobile Printers The mobile app for Schoork supports printing hall passes and tardy slips from a mobile printer.\nSupported Printers If you have a mobile printer that is not on the list below, contact us.\n   Manufacturer Model     Zebra iMZ220   Zebra ZQ310    "});index.add({'id':17,'href':'/docs/misc/privacy/','title':"Privacy Policy",'content':"Privacy Policy Note: The audience of this privacy policy is the school, district, or ogranization that pays us for to use our software. Individuals cannot receive their individual data upon request.\nPrivacy of your data is important to us at Schoork. That\u0026rsquo;s why we try to keep this policy as simple to read as possible. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us.\nCollecting Data Schoork is a data management system, so it needs data to be useful. Most of the data in Schoork is the data you input directly into the system. We may collect data from third-party sources (data from your student management system), but only at your direction.\nWe also collect a few tidbits of data when users login to the site, such as their IP address and browser information. This is stored in case we need to examine it for a site attack.\nSelling and Sharing Data Unlike some other sites, we are not in the business of selling your data (or giving it away for free) to third-party companies. It\u0026rsquo;s simple. We won\u0026rsquo;t sell your data to third-parties. Unless you authorize it, we won\u0026rsquo;t give your data away to third-parties. Why might you authorize it? What if you want to send your data to your state educational agency? We will share it with them, if you ask us to.\nData Requests Do you want your data? You can have it. Schoork has some built-in tools to allow you to export data whenever you wish. If you want all of your data, or the tool doesn\u0026rsquo;t give you the data you need, ask us and we will give it to you in a jiffy.\nFERPA Compliance Schoork may store some Personally Identifiable Information (PII) for your students. To remain FERPA-compliant (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974), we ensure this information is only accessible to users who sign in with an email and password combination. We also attempt to limit, as much as possible, the ability for PII to be sent via unprotected email. For instance, when a user is sent an email about a student\u0026rsquo;s office referral, the student\u0026rsquo;s name and the description are not given in the email. A user must login to see this information.\nThere are some ways that users might circumvent these efforts and be able to send PII through email methods. Where users can affect the text of an email, we warn them not to include PII data.\nDigital Signing Schoork uses a method of digitally signing documents. Users and parents are prompted before signing documents, so they always have a way to back out.\n"});index.add({'id':18,'href':'/docs/students/referrals/','title':"Referrals",'content':"Workflow The diagram below shows the general workflow of a referral in Schoork.

If a user cannot add a referral for a particular student who is in Schoork, it is likely that they don\u0026rsquo;t share a school in common.\nUsers with the Admin permission can add and remove users from schools.\nCompleting Referrals Users with the Discipline permission can complete referrals (these users can also add and complete referrals in one single step). To complete a referral, click the Edit button next to the referral on the referrals page.\nConsequences may be marked as HL (Hot List) and/or Serves (Consequence Served). See the above tab for Consequences for more information on these types of consequences.\nNotifications Some users may be notified when a referral is submitted and completed.\n When adding a referral, all users with the Discipline permission who are also assigned as admin users of a school will receive a notification of the referral via email. When completing a referral, the user who submitted the referral will receive an email notification that it has been completed.

Users and parents can set their signature one time, and then use Schoork to digitally sign documents. Documents signed with a digital signature print the name of the user (or parent) and the timestamp when they signed the form.\nSigning Passwords Note: For the sake of brevity below, a user can mean either a user or a parent.\nWhen users create their signature, they must also input a signing password, which is different from the password they use to sign into Schoork. This signing password is stored in our database in an encrypted format. Each time the user signs a form, they must also input their signing password, and this must match the same password they entered when created their signature. If the passwords don\u0026rsquo;t match, they can\u0026rsquo;t sign the document.\nThe signing password can be reset, if a user forgets it, via an email prompt.\n"});index.add({'id':20,'href':'/docs/students/tardy_slips/','title':"Tardy Slips",'content':"Tardy slips are a mostly mobile feature. They are designed to be printed on a mobile printer when they are assigned.\nMobile Printers Currently Schoork supports printing on the Zebra iMZ220 (discontinued) and the ZQ310. If your school doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a mobile printer but would like to invest in some, we do recommend the ZQ310. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to use and already works with Schoork.

Tardy consequences rely on Consequences to function, so at least one of these must exist in order to add a tardy consequence.\nUsers with the Admin permission can add these under Setup in the sidebar.\nConsequences Consequences are assigned a regular and short name. The short name is used for some PDF reports.\nIf the Add to Hot List checkbox is checked, then any student receiving this consequence will be automatically added to the Hot List for all dates between the start and end date of the consequence.\nThe Create Consequence Served Entry checkbox does not affect tardy slips.\nTardy Consequences Tardy Consequences are designed so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to add a default consequence for each tardy number. Instead, they list the lowest tardy number they trigger at, and that consequence will trigger until another tardy consequence is listed.\nHere is an example in which a user has created three tardy consequences.\n   Consequence Lowest Tardy Count Trigger     Warning 1   Parent Contact 4   Lunch Detention 5    In this example, a student would receive a warning for tardies 1, 2, and 3. On tardy 4, the student would receive a parent contact. For tardies 5 and on, the student would recieve lunch detention.\n Resetting Tardies Users with the Admin permission can reset all tardy counts to 0. Tardies are still saved, but as a student accumulates more tardies, the count will start over with 1. This can be used at the end of a nine weeks, semester, or whenever you want.\n"});index.add({'id':21,'href':'/docs/misc/mobile_printers/zebra/','title':"Zebra",'content':"Zebra Mobile Printer Support Schoork supports printing on the Zebra iMZ220 and the ZQ310.\nNot Printing If your Zebra printer is not printing when you log a tardy,\n Make sure your printer is on Make sure your printer is linked to your phone via a bluetooth connection  Printing Gibberish If your Zebra mobile printer is printing an unintelligble mix of symbols and characters,\n Download the Zebra Printer Setup Utility from the App Store Open the app Click the menu icon in the top left corner Select your connected printer Click Device Language Click Set Device Lanaguage Change the Device Language to ZPL Click Apply (the app may set the device language to XML and ZPL, this is fine)  Your printer should now print the correctly formatted tardy slips.\nTL;DR The menu icon - three stacked, horizontal lines - is sometimes called a hamburger icon.
