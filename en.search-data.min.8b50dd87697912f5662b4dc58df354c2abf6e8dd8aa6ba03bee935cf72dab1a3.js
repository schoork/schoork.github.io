Since I have worked as a teacher, administrator-in-training, assistant principal, principal, and associate superintendent in several districts and one charter organization in Mississippi and Tennessee.\nIn my roles I became increasingly frustrated with the state of educational technology, which tends to be built poorly (here\u0026rsquo;s looking at you TIMS) and/or ineffectively. A lot of times software is built by engineers who don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of experience in the field, and when educators and engineers can\u0026rsquo;t speak the same language, we get programs that make us work harder than pencil and paper would.\nAs I became more frustrated, I sought to do something about that. First I started with Google Apps Scripts, a backend, JavaScript-like service that allows you to automate Google\u0026rsquo;s frontend services (i.e. Forms, Spreadsheets, Docs, etc.). I eventually moved from PHP to Python, and, finally, to Ruby on Rails. With the help of some books, the internet, and some really awesome friends, I built Schoork.\nAbout Schoork Schoork is designed and built to make educators\u0026rsquo; jobs easier and more efficient. It is a set of digital tools that schools and districts can use to increase productivity and transparency within their organizations.\nSchoork achieves this through three main methods:\n Automated communication between platforms and people Digitizing the non-digital Built-in flexibility  Navigating the Site Left Sidebar The left sidebar is where you will find access to all pages on this support site. They are generally broken into the same major sections as the sidebar on Schoork.  Search If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for something in particular, try the search box in the left sidebar. It searches every page on this site for what you\u0026rsquo;re you type.  Right Sidebar The right sidebar lists all of the major sections on the given page you\u0026rsquo;re on. Click one to be instantly taken to that part of the page.   Ten Minute Rule We ask that your try to use our site to answer the question(s) you have, but if you are spending more than ten minutes and still can\u0026rsquo;t figure it out, email us and we will respond as quickly as we can.  Navigating Schoork Sidebar Schoork also has a sidebar. Schoork\u0026rsquo;s sidebar is divided into major sections (students, users, financials, and setup) and subsections. Clicking on a module takes it to it\u0026rsquo;s main page, while clicking the (Add) link next to it will take you to a new form.  Buttons Buttons are the other ways to get around in Schoork. Most module pages have a table listing a bunch of records. Generally these tables will have buttons like show, edit, print, remove. These tend to be very consistent across the site of what they do.   "});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/docs/students/','title':"Students",'content':"Students Adding Students Schoork supports two main ways of adding students to the system:\n Online registration Automated upload from a student management system  Online Registration Schoork has an optional online registration component for districts who want to use it. The form allows your district to gather wanted information about a student one time and print it on as many forms as desired. Information, such as a student\u0026rsquo;s name, birthdate, grade, and school are collected once from the parent but printed on every single form. This is meant to decrease the amount of time it takes parents to complete the registration process for their child(ren) and can also be used to accomodate offsite registration.\nVerifcation In working with a school district in Mississippi, we found that it was highly valuable to have a parent complete the registration process with a staff member to ensure all information was correct and completed. We added a small module to flag students for different forms that had been signed (i.e. media release, internet and device usage, etc.).\nAutomated Upload Schoork also supports automated uploads from your original Student Management System using a variety of formats for transfer, including SFTP and API methods. We will work with you to streamline this process so you can set it up once and not think about it again. Removing Students Schoork will not allow you to delete students, however, you can mark them as inactive. This process can be automated if you are using the Automated Upload from your SMS (above) or can be done manually by users with the Scheduling permission.\nTL;DR We don\u0026rsquo;t allow you to remove or delete students because too many modules rely on an associated student (or set of students) to function. For instance, every office referral, IEP, MTSS folder, and counseling session is assigned to one or more students. Deleting a student would mean that you couldn\u0026rsquo;t access those referrals ever again.\nIn the example below, removing Student01 would mean that we would lose Referral01 and Referral02 and would not be able to access them for data or historical purpsoses.\n   mermaid.initialize({ flowchart: { useMaxWidth:true } });  classDiagram Student01 "});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/docs/parents/appointments/','title':"Appointments",'content':"Appointments Parent Appointments is a module that allows parents to request an appointment with a staff member.

Sections require periods and courses.\nSections Users with the Scheduling permission can add sections and assign students to them.\nMeeting days allows Schoork to send an automated attendance reminder in the afternoon to all teachers who haven\u0026rsquo;t taken attendance for a section that meets on that day. If a class meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays, then the teacher won\u0026rsquo;t receive the reminder on Mondays, Wednesdays, or Fridays.\nTo add students to a section, select the desired student or students (hold CTRL or âŒ˜ to select multiple students) and click the green arrow button. The red arrow button is used to remove students from the section.\nAttendance Codes Users with the Admin permission can add attendance codes from the Setup section in the sidebar. Each attendance code is asssigned a name and short name.\nAttendance codes are either absent codes (checked) or present codes (unchecked). Students assigned an absent code are listed on the Daily Absences page.\nYou can set the order that attendance codes appear when a user takes attendance by ordering them in the table on the main Attendance Codes page. Simply drag and drop them until they are ordered the way you want. We recommend that you have the most used code be the one listed first, since all students will default to this code when users take attendance.\nPeriods and Courses Periods and courses can be added by users with the Admin permission in the Setup section of the sidebar. Daily Absences The Daily Absences page lists the students who have been marked as absent for any section. Users with the Attendance permission can change the attendance code of a student by clicking on the blue code.\nThe page also lists the sections for which users have not yet taken attendance that also meet that day (see Initial Setup above). Users with the Attendance permission can take attendance for any section by clicking the blue button.\n"});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/docs/parents/concerns/','title':"Concerns",'content':"Concerns When a parent has a concern or request, they can submit a Parent Concern via Schoork.

To invite parents, they must have a parent account, although they do not need to be linked to the student.\nWhen you add users, you also assign them a role, which is used on several forms (including the MET Documentation form and the Attendance form). Only users with the Agency Representative role will be able to assign the Amendment form.\nSending Invites Saving the IEP Meeting does not immediately make the meeting available to parents and users. The members invited to the meeting will be listed under the Invitees section. Clicking the Send Invites button will send an automated email to the parents and users, allowing them to access the meeting and its forms and documents and giving them the ability to RSVP to the meeting.\nForms Every IEP meeting comes with all of the forms you would need for any meeting. Those that are used in all meetings, such as the Attendance form, are automatically added. Forms that you may only use sometimes, like the MET Documentation form, must be added by clicking the Add button.\nStatus Most forms have a status that is defaulted to Draft. When a form is in Draft mode, parents and users will not be able to sign them or print them. When you have completed editing a form, and are ready for others to see/sign it, change the status to Draft Completed.\nSigning Forms If users and parents have set their signatures, they can digitally sign forms (otherwise they will have to sign the forms the old fashioned way). Each digital signature will show the person\u0026rsquo;s signature, their name, their role for the meeting (see Inviting Parents and Users), and the timestamp of when they signed the form.\nDocuments You can also upload documents by editing the meeting and using the Add File button. This feature is avaialble for adding hand-signed forms and other documents relevant to the meeting. Academic and Behavior Goals IEPs also have a way to set and log academic and behavioral goals for students. Once set, data for these goals can be logged manually so that Schoork can automatically create charts showing the student\u0026rsquo;s progress over time.\nThe Report of Progress button will download a report showing the student\u0026rsquo;s progress as compared to their target.\nBehavioral goals can be added this way or can be added using the Student Supports and Behavior Trackers module. If data is added using behavior trackers, it will be automatically added to charts on the IEP, too.\nTL;DR IEP Meetings are a prime example of how we at Schoork believe software should act. When you were using paper forms, or even forms from some other digital IEP providers, you had to type or write the same information on multiple forms. That\u0026rsquo;s time you could spend doing other, more important things (i.e. working with students, planning lessons, spending time with your family, sipping mai tais on the beach, etc.).\nInstead, our IEP forms use the information entered once to populate as many forms as possible.\n "});index.add({'id':8,'href':'/docs/mobile_printers/','title':"Mobile Printers",'content':"Mobile Printers The mobile app for Schoork supports printing hall passes and tardy slips from a mobile printer.\nSupported Printers If you have a mobile printer that is not on the list below, contact us.\n   Manufacturer Model     Zebra iMZ220   Zebra ZQ310    "});index.add({'id':9,'href':'/docs/parents/','title':"Parents",'content':"Parents Parents can sign up for a Schoork Parent account with their email address.
